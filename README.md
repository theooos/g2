## Description

Phaseshift is a top-down shoot 'em up, created by six undergraduate second-year students at the University of Birmingham for submission in the Team Project module.

It relies on quick reactions, and phalangal dexterity, to kill your opponents before they do the same to you.  
But there's a catch.  
In this game, there exist two dimensions. Though you my be battling for your life in one, your enemy could be sneaking up to you in the other. Jumping fast across the thin fold of realities is an important tactic to employ, to both evade havoc... and cause it.

But you're not alone. This war that has raged for eons stirred an ancient power, one which until now has lain dormant and undiscovered. Many call them Orbs. Beings of pure energy. And they intend to stop this war, before the war destroys the universe.
